# Guessing-Game

Hello GitHub!

This is my first repo on GitHub.

A Simple Number Guessing Game Project using python to commemorate my python Begginer days.
Beginner Level.
Beacuse what could be best as a first repository than a classic guessing game !

## guess the number project
user enters number
computer generater a random number between 0 and 100
program compares the two numbers
program exits immediatly if user guesses correctly in any round
program continues at the allowed guessing rounds (i) as long as the guess is wrong


I AM PUBLISHING IT BECAUSE I CAN !
